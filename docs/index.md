# dokku Provider

Interact with dokku

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "dokku" {
  ssh_host = "127.0.0.1"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `ssh_host` (String) Host to connect to

### Optional

- `log_ssh_commands` (Boolean) Print SSH commands with ERROR level
- `ssh_cert` (String) Certificate to use. Default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Supported formats:
- file:/a or /a or ./a or ~/a - use provided value as path to certificate file
- env:ABCD or $ABCD - use env var ABCD
- raw:----.. or ----... - use provided value as raw certificate
- `ssh_port` (Number) Port to connect to. Default: 22
- `ssh_user` (String) Username to use. Default: dokku
- `upload_app_name` (String) This attribute is used to upload local files to remote server using storage.local_directory attribute.
App name to use for local file synchronization. Default: storage-sync

Since dokku don't allow to upload files directly, workaround is used.
Algorithm is:
1. Create helper application, using name, provided in this attribute
2. Mount desired remote directory as /mnt
3. Deploy "busybox" docker image deployed to app
4. [on client side] Create tar archive for local_directory and encode it using base64
5. Connect to app using "dokku enter" and use a bunch of echo-s to make file "tmp.tar.base64", and then decode and un-tar it to /mnt
- `upload_split_bytes` (Number) This attribute is used to upload local files to remote server using storage.local_directory attribute.
Number of bytes to split uploaded base64-encoded tar archive. See details in description to "upload_app_name" attribute. Default: 256

Due to limited length of commands we can't use one echo to copy entire file.
So we need to split file into parts no larger than upload_split_bytes.
Don't use big values because if length of command exceed the limit then all operation will hang out.
